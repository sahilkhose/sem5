Write two separate connection-oriented C programs (one for the Server and one for Client) using UNIX socket APIs for following operations with acknowledgements. 
Server stores the following information about one employee in the file: Emp Id, Employee Name, Basic Salary (Monthly).  Client will have three menu driven operations: Insert, Display and Update.
1. Clients sends the second employee data to be written in the file for Insert Operation. (1.5 M to write in file)
2. Client sends Emp Id to server to fetch the details of the employee. Display the details from the file at the client side. Perform (2.5M to communication and display) 
3. Server calculates the Updated Salary = (Basic Salary + % of Basic Salary as Allowances) â€“ Income Tax Deduction, for both the employees. And write Updated Salary into the file (Here % Allowance and Income Tax Deduction value can be hard coded.) (4M: Calculation and writing in the file)
4. Server sends the new data to client at the client side, for display operation. (2M: Communication and display)
